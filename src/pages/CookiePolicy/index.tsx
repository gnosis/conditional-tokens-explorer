                Cookies are a feature of web browser software that allows web servers to recognize
                the computer or device used to access a website. A cookie is a small text file that
                a website saves on your computer or mobile device when you visit the site. It
                enables the website to remember your actions and preferences (such as login,

                don&apos;t have to keep re-entering them whenever you come back to the site or
